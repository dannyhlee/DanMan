#### IEEE Definition of Software Engineering

(1) The application of a systematic,disciplined,quantifiable approach to the development,operation and maintenance of software; that is, the application of engineering to software.

(2) The study of approaches as in the above statement.

- Systematic - a process is involved
- Disciplined - a predictable output
- Quantifiable - there are metrics and measurements

#### Lifecycle Phases

- Requirements - stakeholders discuss and capture requirements from stakeholders, through interviews, discussions, workshops, etc.
- Design - high level design of software and system to be able to be able to deliver each requirement, risk's are discussed, team capabilities, constraints thought of
- Coding/Build - Bringing reality by coding, unit testing according to design
- Testing - Testing if software functions as desired, defects are fixed and tested again
- Deployment/Implementation - Software is fully tested and high priority issues are removed and deployed to customers
- Maintenance - Once a version is released to production, the support team does maintenance

#### Software Development Lifecycle Model

- Waterfall (systematic)
  - Deliverables at each stage
  - Requirements are clear 
  - System is prepared before hand and is a reference
  - Requirements gathering, Analysis & Design, Construction, Testing, Deployment phases
- Prototyping (building archetypes)
  - building a model of system
  - could be used as-is or with refinements
  - built in increments which are working and demonstrable
  - may take time and budget
- Spiral (focuses on risks)
  - Plan - determine objectives and identify constraints
  - Risk Analysis - identify alternatives and resolve risks
  - Evaluate - review and release
  - Develop - code and test next version
  - A meta-model creating iterive stages
- Rapid Application Development (focuses on fast development)
  - Good for small projects and small teams, with tight deadlines
  - Based on prototyping and iterative development. 
  - Rapid cycles of development and release
  - focus on gather requirements, and gathering feedback
  - Continuous integration and rapid delivery
  
  #### Project Roles
  - Sponsor: Provides budget and makes high level decisions
  - Business: Provides functional requirements and if the deliverables meet requirements
  - Project manager: Brings required ppl together and manages budget and communication b/w stakeholders
  - Architect: Plans structure and interactions at high level
  - Designer: Build models and etailed design of user experience
  - Software devs: Translate design to working solutiopn
  - Software tester: Tests ssoftware meets expected requirements
  - Operations or support: 
    - L1 support- interacts directly with clients and customers
    - L2 support - solves more technical problems
    - L3 support - more complex issues and infrastructure

## Gathering requirements

- Gather the requirements from stakeholders through interviews, workshops, questionnaires, task analysis, observation, brainstorming, prototyping, scenario identification
- Classify and analyse the gathered requirements.
- Create requirement specification document to solidify understanding of requirements (Software Requirements Specification - SRS)
- Verify that the gathered, analysed and documented requirements match the stakeholders requirements fully.

Requirements should be: necessary, concise, unambiguous, consisten, complete, implementable, testable, traceable, identifiable.
