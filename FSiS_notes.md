## Part 5: Parametricity and the Traverse type class

### Parametricity

In programming language theory, parametricity is an abstract uniformity property enjoyed by parametrically polymorphic functions, which captures the intuition that all instances of a polymorphic function act the same way.

### Parametric Polymorphism

- maintains full type-safety
- Using PP, we can write functions and data types generically so different values can be handled the same way, regardless of type.

### Traverse types
